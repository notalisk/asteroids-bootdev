# Asteroids - BootDev Project

This is a very simple mini asteroids game that I made in pygame. The base game was built as a guided project with bootdev, additional features (such as the menu) were made completely by yours truly.

## Installation

Clone down the repo and run the following command to install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Play

Start the game by running the main.py file.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Click the start button, and navigate using the wasd keys. Shoot the asteriods using the space bar.
